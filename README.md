# PsyPractice AI – Resource Repository

This repository contains supporting materials for a custom-built ChatGPT assistant designed to support clinical psychology students and early-career practitioners in developing core therapeutic competencies.

The GPT is intended for **educational and training purposes only** and does not provide real therapy or clinical decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

PsyPractice AI is built to simulate and enhance key aspects of therapist training by enabling users to:

- Practise **micro-counselling skills** (e.g., validation, reflection, open questions)
- Roleplay therapy sessions using selected modalities (CBT, ACT, DBT, MI or mixed)
- Request structured **intervention practice** (e.g., psychoeducation, behavioural activation)
- Receive **treatment planning support** based on client formulations or case descriptions (ensure to de-identify before uploading)
- Upload de-identified transcripts and receive structured **session evaluation feedback**
- Understand how to apply skills within a therapeutic framework (e.g., 5Ps formulation)

## 🧩 Features of the Custom GPT

Upon starting, the GPT provides a **menu of training options**, including:

1. 🧑‍🏫 Micro-skills roleplay
2. 💬 Intervention practice (by modality or vignette)
3. 🧠 Treatment planning and case formulation support
4. 📋 Transcript evaluation using rubric-based feedback
5. ⚠️ Live session guidance (planned for future version)

Each feature uses structured prompts and uploads to help simulate real-world clinical supervision and skill development.
