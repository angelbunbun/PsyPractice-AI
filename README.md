# PsyPractice AI

**PsyPractice AI** is a custom-built GPT designed to support clinical psychology placement students and early-career practitioners in strengthening their therapeutic skills through structured, simulated learning.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

PsyPractice AI offers a self-guided, feedback-oriented training space where users can:

- Practise **micro-counselling skills** (e.g., validation, reflection, guiding)
- Engage in **intervention roleplays** (CBT, ACT, DBT, CFT, EMDR or mixed)
- Receive structured feedback on **de-identified transcript submissions**
- Explore **case formulation and treatment planning**
- Build session fluency with diverse modalities and client presentations, drawing on content sourced directly from comprehensive therapy manuals (i.e., DBT manual) rather than general internet summaries.

## 🧩 Core Features

Upon launch, PsyPractice AI presents a training menu where users can:

🧑‍🏫 Micro-skills Roleplay

💬 Intervention Practice

🧠 Case Formulation + Treatment Planning

📋 Transcript Evaluation & Feedback

📚 Intervention Fluency + Learning Support

---

🧑‍🏫 Micro-skills Roleplay
Practise foundational counselling microskills such as open-ended questioning, reflection, validation, and summarising. The GPT acts as a simulated client and provides feedback based on a structured rubric. Simulated clients are based on mixed presentations, ages, genders and range from mild, moderate or severe symptomology. 

💬 Intervention Practice
Select a therapy modality (e.g., CBT, ACT, DBT, CFT) and engage in roleplays to practise delivering psychoeducation, skill coaching, or behavioural interventions. You can request specific modules (e.g., behavioural activation, distress tolerance) or allow the GPT to present randomised vignettes.

🧠 Case Formulation + Treatment Planning
Provide a case snapshot or basic history. The GPT will assist in generating a 5Ps formulation (Presenting, Predisposing, Precipitating, Perpetuating, Protective), suggest appropriate treatment targets, and recommend intervention sequencing. Information suggested has been taken across research papers, evidence-based information and scraped from intervention manuals. 

📋 Transcript Evaluation & Feedback
Upload or paste a de-identified session transcript. The GPT will evaluate it using a micro-skills rubric (uploaded into the GPT) and provide structured feedback, including skill ratings, missed opportunities, and suggested improvements.

📚 Intervention Fluency + Learning Support
Ask the GPT questions about therapeutic concepts or modules (e.g., “How do I create a CFT formulation for this client?”). The GPT queries content directly from full manuals (e.g., DBT, CBT, ACT, CFT), offering guidance grounded in actual clinical resources—not just surface-level summaries (such as other GPTs). 

This API connects the GPT to a private, hosted search tool that scans full-text therapy manuals in real time and returns the most relevant excerpts. As a result, the GPT can provide guidance grounded in real clinician resources—not surface-level web content or hallucinated summaries._

Each module uses structured rubrics and supporting documents to mimic realistic clinical supervision.
